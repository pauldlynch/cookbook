Cookbook
========

Jekyll based html content for my cookbook recipes.

I wrote these recipes originally for my son Andrew, when he went away to college.  I extended them when my youngest son, Christopher, went to university, and have added to them when I wanted to, or when I was asked to.

The first of these are Pages documents shared on [iWork.com](http://iwork.com), and can be viewed, downloaded in various formats and printed; most of them are sitting on this web site. The basic idea is to create a collection of student friendly recipes that are nutritious, cheap to make and simple to prepare, but there may have been some scope creep.

Good luck!

Feel free to share this page with anyone.

The dates on the posts for most of the pages are from when I restored from a backup after a web site problem.  The current site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/); an older version was hosted via my web site and a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog, with [AutoIndex](http://autoindex.sourceforge.net/) used to just list the text files containing the recipes.

Build & deploy instructions:

    jekyll --no-auto --no-server; rake rsync:live
