The is Anna Del Conte's recipe from the Sainsbury magazine!

- 1\.8 - 2 kg pork loin (boned)
- 4 cloves garlic
- 150-175g cubed pancetta
- zest 1 1/2 lemons
- 2 tbs thyme
- 1 dsp dried chillies
- 1 tbs olive oil
- 12 fl oz dry white wine
- chicken stock (300 ml) - or a very good quality stock cube

Unroll the loin, and make three deep, long slits lengthwise to insert the stuffing.

Mix the zest, garlic, pancetta, thyme and chili - all finely chopped.  Push this mixture into the slits, and retie the loin with some string.  Season with a good sprinkling of sea salt, then rub with olive oil.  Leave to marinate overnight in a cool place.

Preheat oven to 220 C.  Put pork in a roasting tin, and pour over the remaining oil.  Roast for 20 mins, turning once.

Warm the wine, and pour over the pork.  Cook for 1 hr 20 mins at 190 C, turning every 20 - 30  mins.  Rest for 20 mins.

Skim off the fat from the roasting tin, then make gravy with the stock.  Dissolve all the sticky juices, and simmer for 10 - 20 minutes.

Serve with pepperonata and cannelini beans warmed with sage and garlic (and a little virgin olive oil).
