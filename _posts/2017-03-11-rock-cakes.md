Rock cakes were a very traditional part of afternoon tea when I was
young, although without the spices that were added in
[Delia's version](http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/occasions/easter/easter-recipes-to-make-with-children/good-old-rock-cakes). That
old, 1950s/60s version would have used no spice, and white caster
sugar, with a little demerara sugar sprinkled on top; and, very
probably, self-raising flour. These are quite sweet, so butter/jam is
optional - we always ate them plain, anyway.

## Ingredients

- 350g plain flour
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 2 level tsp baking powder
- 175g golden caster sugar (Delia uses light brown sugar)
- 0.25 tsp grated nutmeg
- 0.5 tsp mixed spice
- 175g unsalted butter
- 125g mixed dried fruit: or just currants/raisins/sultanas
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 - 2 tbs milk (if needed)

## Method

Preheat the oven to 190C.

Sift flour, salt, baking powder, and spices.  If you can, sift in the
sugar as well, but it won't pass through a very fine sieve, in which
case break up the lumps and stir it in.  Rub in the butter to reach
the texture of fine breadcrumbs. A trick to sieve,  break up lumps,
and rub in the butter at the same time is to use a food processor or
blender for just a few seconds. Stir in the fruit. Now mix in the
beaten egg to form a dough; add the milk if required. This is easiest
to do using just a fork, rather then fingers. The correct texture to
reach is when the crumbs increase in size, and if you squeeze together
a handful they will form a lump, which will just barely not fall
apart. This is a lot drier than you might expect.


Make into 10 - 12 loose heaps on a greased baking sheet, and bake for
18 - 20 minutes.

## Note

Afternoon tea. When I was young, we always had the same for Sunday
tea. Sardines on toast fingers (mashed with a little vinegar), scotch
pancakes cooked on a griddle (aka drop scones) with butter, homemade
jam tarts, rock cakes, a Victoria sponge (sometimes), and
gingerbread - the tray bake variety. Usually with sandwiches of
whatever roast we had had for lunch, or cheese and tomato.
