Drop a teaspoonful of syrup into a jug of iced water and allow to cool:

thread = 220-230F

The syrup forms threads that won't make a ball.

Soft ball = 240/243F

The syrup makes a ball that doesn't hold shape.

hard ball (122C/252F) = 250-260F

What it says!

hard crack (160C/320F) 130C/266F = 285-299F

The syrup makes strands that break.
