Adapted from various Simon Hopkinson recipes for Creme Caramel.

## Ingredients

- 450 ml (1pt) full fat milk
- pinch of salt
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 120g sugar
- 2 whole eggs (or 3, if available)
- 4 egg yolks
- 75g sugar (white, or golden caster)

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 150C and boil a kettle.

Make caramel by putting the 120g sugar in a light bottomed pan with
3 - 4 tbs of water. Heat until the right colour, which is a rich
mahogany shade; make sure it doesn't go beyond this, so watch very
carefully. Pour into your dish and leave to cool; I use an old Pyrex
casserole for this.

In a mixing bowl, add the eggs, egg yolks, salt, vanilla, and
remaining sugar. Whisk to blend; you don't want to add too much air to
the mixture. Pour over the caramel.

Put the dish in a close fitting roasting tray, and put that in the
oven. Pour water from the kettle into the tray, to half-way up the
dish. The water shouldn't be too hot - no more than 60C. Cover loosely
with foil.

This will take 40 - 60 minutes. Test frequently as you get close; you
are aiming for a gentle tremble rather than a big wobble.  Let cool,
and cover with cling film to discourage too thick a skin from forming.

Serve alone, or with whipped cream.

## Variations

You can infuse coffee beans and add some espresso to the milk; or add
some orange juice and zest.  But I feel that it is best made and
served plain, just as it is.
