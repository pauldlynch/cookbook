The filling is from Delia Smith.

- 6 ripe passion fruit
- 250g mascarpone
- 200 ml fromage frais
- 1 dsp caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Mix the creams, sugar and vanilla.  Add about 2/3 of the fruit pulp.  Spread half the mix on the bottom layer of a victoria sponge, then add the rest of the pulp.  Top with the remaining half of the cream, then the top layer of the cake.

Raspberries, or any slightly acidic fruit, work well as a substitute, even when frozen.


##All in One Sponge

- 8 oz self raising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 4 large eggs
- 8 oz butter
- 8 oz caster sugar
- (1/2 tsp vanilla extract - optional)

Sieve the flour and baking powder.  Add all the remaining ingredients and mix.  Put into 2 8" cake tins, greased and base lined, and bake for 25-35 minutes at 170/180C.  Cool on a cake rack.


##Classic Sponge (via James Martin)

- 7 oz (200g) softened butter
- 7 oz (200g) caster sugar
- 4 large eggs (230g)
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 7 oz (200g) self raising flour

Heat the oven to 375F, and butter two 8" sponge tins.

First cream the butter and sugar together.  Then put the eggs into a separate bowl and beat very gently to mix; at the end, add the vanilla essence.  Add the eggs in small quantities to avoid curdling; very small to start, then larger as you go on.  If they do split, beating harder usually brings them back together again.

Finally fold in the sifted flour, and put into the tins.  Cook for 20-25 minutes.

It is important to take your time creaming the butter and sugar, and to carefully sift and fold in the flour.
