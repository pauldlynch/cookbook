- 200g frozen bay scallops/queenies
- 50g smoked bacon, in lardons
- 1 tbs butter
- 1 onion, sliced
- 200g cauliflower/potatoes, in small chunks
- 250ml double cream
- 250ml milk
- 100ml water
- 1 bay leaf

Garnish: chopped parsley

Melt the butter in a saucepan, and fry the bacon to crispy.  Add the onion and soften.  About eight to ten minutes so far.

At the same time, boil the cauliflower or potato for 8-10 minutes or until tender.  Drain and add to the pan with the cream, milk, bay leaf and water, add scallops, and simmer for 10 minutes; don't let it boil!  Season.

Remove bay leaf and serve with optional garnish.

##Variation

You can switch the scallops with white fish, smoked haddock, clams, or anything else that you think may work.
