## Ingedients

For the pâte sablée:

- 75 grams (⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon) sugar (I use unrefined cane sugar,
but regular white sugar is fine)
- 150 grams flour — if you use American all-purpose flour, use 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons
- 75 grams cold butter (I use salted, but you can use unsalted and add a
pinch of salt) — if you use regular American butter (which has less
butterfat than European butter), use 7 tablespoons
- Ice-cold water or milk

For the filling:

- 135 grams (1 ¼ cups) shelled walnut halves
- 2 tablespoons/40g sugar (I use unrefined cane sugar; regular white
sugar is fine, honey would be lovely, too)
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons crème fraîche (substitute sour cream)
- Optional flavoring: 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, or 1 teaspoon
plum or walnut liqueur, or 1 teaspoon dark rum
- 550 grams (1 ¼ pounds) ripe quetsche plums (substitute any other
variety of plum)

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a 10-inch tart pan with
butter and set aside.

Prepare the pâte sablée. In the bowl of a mixer or blender, combine
the sugar and flour. Add the butter and process in short pulses until
the mixture resembles coarse meal. (Alternatively, rub the butter into
the dry ingredients by hand with the tips of your fingers or a wire
pastry blender.) Add a tablespoon of water or milk and mix again, in
short pulses, until it is absorbed. The dough should still be crumbly,
but it should clump if you gently squeeze a handful in your hand. If
it doesn’t, add a little more water — teaspoon by teaspoon — and give
the dough a few more pulses until it reaches the desired consistency.

Pour the mixture evenly into the prepared tart pan. Using the heels of
your hands and your fingers, press on the dough gently to form a thin
layer, covering the surface of the pan and creating a rim all
around. Don’t worry if the dough feels a little dry, this is
normal. (You can prepare the dough up to a day ahead: cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate.) Bake for 15 minutes, until lightly golden.

While the crust par-bakes, prepare the filling. Combine the walnuts
and sugar in the bowl of your mixer, and grind to a coarse powder. Add
the egg, crème fraîche, and flavoring if using, and mix again. (You
can prepare the walnut cream up to a day ahead: transfer to an
airtight container, refrigerate, and bring to room temperature before
using.) Rinse and dry the plums, cut them in halves, and discard the stones.

Remove the pan from the oven (leave the heat on), and let cool
slightly. Spread walnut cream evenly over the tart shell, and arrange
the plums on top in a circular pattern starting from the
outside. Return to the oven for 30 minutes, until the plums are cooked
through and the walnut cream is set. Transfer to a rack to cool
completely before serving. The tart is best served on the day it is
made, but the leftovers will keep until the next day; cover with foil,
refrigerate, and bring to room temperature before eating.
