## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- Salt and ground black pepper
- 2 cups cooked or canned cannellini beans
- 1 15-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- 4 cups vegetable stock or water
- 1 fresh rosemary sprig
- 1 fresh thyme sprig
- 1 pound chopped kale or escarole
- 4 large, thick slices whole-grain bread, toasted
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan

## Directions

Put 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When
it’s hot, add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; sprinkle with salt and
pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5
to 10 minutes.

Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain the beans; if they’re canned,
rinse them as well. Add them to the pot along with tomatoes and their
juices and stock, rosemary and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce
heat so the soup bubbles steadily; cover and cook, stirring once or
twice to break up the tomatoes, until the flavors meld, 15 to 20
minutes.

Fish out and discard rosemary and thyme stems, if you like, and stir
in kale. Taste and adjust seasoning. Lay bread slices on top of the
stew so they cover the top and overlap as little as possible. Scatter
red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3
tablespoons oil and sprinkle with Parmesan.

Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onions and cheese
are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. (If your pot fits under the
broiler, you can also brown the top there.) Divide the soup and bread
among 4 bowls and serve.
