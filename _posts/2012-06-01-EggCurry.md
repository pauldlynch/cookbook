This is Madhur Jaffrey's Eggs Massala recipe, and is apparently her favourite comfort food.  Recipe is for two people.

4 large eggs
1 small/medium onion, grated or finely chopped
1" fresh ginger, grated or finely chopped

0\.5 tsp chili powder
0\.5 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
0\.25 tsp salt
1 tsp lemon juice
ground black pepper
1 tbs water
2 tbs oil
0\.5 tsp cumin seeds
8 fl oz (half a tin) tomatoes, drained and chopped
0\.25 tsp sugar
4 tbs coriander leaves

Put the eggs into a saucepan of cold water, bring to the boil.  Turn the heat down, and leave for six minutes.  Drain, and cool with a couple of changes of cold water.  Peel, and cut into halves lengthwise.

Mix all the ground spices, salt, lemon juice and water to form a paste (so NOT the cumin seeds).

Heat the oil in a pan until it shimmers, then add the cumin seeds for 10 seconds, then add the onion and ginger.  Cook to medium brown (try to avoid any burnt bits).  Add the spice paste and cook for 15 seconds, then add the tomatoes and sugar.  Cover and simmer for ten minutes.

Add the green coriander, then put the eggs into the pan and cover with some of the sauce.  Heat for about two minutes.
