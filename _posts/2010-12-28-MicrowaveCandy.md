## Microwave Nut Brittle
Published: December 21, 2010

Time: 30 to 40 minutes, plus 30 minutes’ cooling

- 2 cups raw nuts or seeds
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 cup corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.

1. Chop the nuts or seeds if they are large; otherwise, leave them whole. Put them into a 4-quart glass bowl with all other ingredients except the baking soda and vanilla extract. Stir in 3/4 cup water. Heat in a microwave oven on high power for 5 minutes. Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully transfer the bowl to a countertop and stir with a heat-resistant spatula. Repeat 2 or 3 more times, until the syrup thickens and the nuts begin to stick together. Then heat for 1-minute periods, stirring in between, until the syrup begins to turn light golden brown.

2. Line a baking sheet with foil. Add the baking soda and vanilla extract to the syrup and stir vigorously. Quickly pour the mixture out onto the baking sheet and use the spatula to spread it as thin as possible. Allow to cool to room temperature, then peel off the foil and break the brittle into pieces. Store in an airtight container.

Yield: About 2 pounds.


## Microwave Pralines
Published: December 21, 2010

Time: 30 to 40 minutes, plus 50 minutes’ cooling

- 3 cups pecans
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1/3 cup butter
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.

1. Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake in a 350-degree oven until lightly toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.

2. Combine all the ingredients except the pecans and vanilla extract in a 4-quart glass bowl. Heat in a microwave oven on high power for 5 minutes. Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully transfer the bowl to a countertop and stir with a heat-resistant spatula. Return to microwave and heat for 5 more minutes.

3. Stir in the pecans and heat for another 5 minutes. Stir and check the temperature with a digital or candy thermometer. If it reads 240 degrees, proceed to Step 4. If not, continue heating on high power, stirring and checking the temperature every minute until it does.

4. Remove from oven and let the mix sit undisturbed. After 20 minutes, add the vanilla extract and stir vigorously until it becomes cloudy and creamy. Using 2 spoons, scoop and shape into 2-inch-diameter mounds on a baking sheet lined with foil, parchment paper or a silicone mat. If the mix becomes too hard to shape, reheat for 15 seconds. Let the pralines rest for 30 minutes. Keep stored in an airtight container.

Yield: About 30 pralines.


## Microwave Saffron Turkish Delight
Published: December 21, 2010

Time: About 45 minutes, plus 3 hours’ cooling

- 1 1/4 cups cornstarch, plus more for dusting
- 3 cups sugar
- 1/4 cup corn syrup
- 1 teaspoon saffron threads
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 vanilla bean
- Cooking oil, for greasing pan
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar.

1. Pour 2 1/2 cups water into a 4-quart glass bowl. Slowly whisk in 3/4 cup cornstarch until smooth. Transfer to the microwave and cook on high power for 2 minutes. Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully transfer to a countertop and stir with a heat-resistant spatula. Return to microwave and heat 1 minute at a time, stirring between heatings, until the mixture thickens, bubbles and becomes translucent, about 5 to 6 minutes. Then heat on half power for 3 minutes.

2. Mix in the sugar, corn syrup and saffron. Heat on high power for 5 minutes. Stir and repeat, then stir and repeat again. After the last time, stir in the lemon juice. Slit the vanilla bean lengthwise, scrape all the seeds into the mixture and stir to combine. (Save the bean for another use.)

3. Continue to heat on high power for 3-minute periods, stirring in between, until a little syrup scraped onto the edge of a cold plate quickly sets to a tacky solid, from 12 to 21 minutes.

4. Grease an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking oil and scrape and spread the mix into it. Allow to rest, uncovered, until it is firm enough to handle, several hours or overnight. Dust the top with cornstarch. Invert onto a small cutting board, using a spatula if needed, and dust the other side with cornstarch. Transfer the board to the freezer for 30 minutes. Cut into 3/4-inch squares with scissors or a knife.

5. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup cornstarch and the powdered sugar, and toss the squares in it. Store the candy in this mixture in a wide, shallow container.

Yield: About 120 pieces.
