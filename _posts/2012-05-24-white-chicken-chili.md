For two.

- 2 chicken breasts (prefer with skin and bone, but good luck getting that from a supermarket)
- 1 jalapeno chili (green chili alternative)
- 1 poblano chili (green pepper alternative)
- 1 anaheim chili (1 thai/finger chili alternative)
- 1 small onion, cut into chunks
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 0\.5 tsp ground coriander
- 1 can cannellini beans, drained
- 8 fl oz chicken stock
- 0\.5 small bunch coriander leaves
- juice of 0.5 lime
- 2 spring onions, sliced thinly

Sauté the chicken pieces whole to barely brown, about 5 minutes.

Put the chicken to one side and sauté the chilis and onion plus
spices, garlic and a little salt in a tablespoon of oil until soft -
up to about 10 minutes.

In a food processor pulse to smooth half the chili and onion mix plus
half the beans. Put back into the pan with the stock and chicken until
the chicken is done, about 10-15 minutes (160F for breast, 175F for
thighs). Remove and shred the chicken (remove and discard bones and
skin at this point, if you were lucky enough to have some), put in the
remaining beans and the chicken and simmer until thickened slightly.
Garnish with the rest of the ingredients (coriander leaves, spring
onions, lime juice) and serve.

The chilis above are ideal, but hard to source in the UK, hence the
substitutions.  You can use a hand blender instead of the food
processor, it could be more convenient.
