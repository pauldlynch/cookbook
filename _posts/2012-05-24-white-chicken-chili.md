For two.

- 2 chicken breasts (prefer with skin and bone, but good luck getting that from a supermarket)
- 1 jalapeno chili (green chili alternative)
- 1 poblano chili (green pepper alternative)
- 1 anaheim chili (1 thai/finger chili alternative)
- 1 small onion, cut into chunks
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 0\.5 tsp ground coriander
- 1 can cannellini beans, drained
- 8 fl oz chicken stock
- 0\.5 small bunch coriander leaves
- juice of 0.5 lime
- 2 spring onions, sliced thinly

Saute chicken to barely brown, about 5 mins.  Skin, if you were lucky enough to have some.

Chop (in a food processor) chilis and onion; some chunks remaining are fine.  Remove chicken and saute the mixture plus spices and a little salt until soft - up to about 10 minutes.

Pulse in food processor half the mix plus half the beans with half the stock.  Put back into the pan with the chicken until chicken is done, about 10-15 minutes (160F, 175F for thighs).  Remove and shred the chicken, put in beans and simmer until thickened slightly.  Add rest of ingredients and serve.

The chilis above are ideal, but hard to source in the UK, hence the substitutions.  You can use a hand blender instead of the food processor, it is probably going to be more convenient.
