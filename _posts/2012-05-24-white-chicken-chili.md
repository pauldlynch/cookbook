For two.

- 2 chicken breasts (prefer with skin and bone, but good luck getting that from a supermarket)
- 1 jalapeno chili (green chili alternative)
- 1 poblano chili (green pepper alternative)
- 1 anaheim chili (1 thai/finger chili alternative)
- 1 small onion, cut into chunks
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 0\.5 tsp ground coriander
- 1 can cannellini beans, drained
- 8 fl oz chicken stock
- 0\.5 small bunch coriander leaves
- juice of 0.5 lime
- 2 spring onions, sliced thinly

Sauté the chicken pieces whole to barely brown, about 5 mins, then remove the skin (and bones), if you were lucky enough to have some.

Coarsely chop (in a food processor) chilis and onion; some chunks remaining are fine.  Remove chicken and sauté the mixture plus spices, garlic and a little salt in a tablespoon of oil until soft - up to about 10 minutes.

In a food processor pulse to smooth half the mix plus half the beans with half the stock.  Put back into the pan with the chicken until chicken is done, about 10-15 minutes (160F, 175F for thighs).  Remove and shred the chicken, put in the remaining beans and the chicken and simmer until thickened slightly.  Add rest of the ingredients (coriander leaves, spring onions, lime juice) and serve.

The chilis above are ideal, but hard to source in the UK, hence the substitutions.  You can use a hand blender instead of the food processor, it is probably going to be more convenient.
