## Ingredients

- 4 Seville oranges (the rind, no pith)
- 1/2 pound (225g) of granulated white sugar
- 2 cloves
- 1 litre of gin (medium quality, supermarket own brands work well)

## Directions

Pour off 250 ml of gin and reserve. (We always buy the same brand and
have a half full bottle knocking around for topping up.)

Carefully pare the orange rind (avoiding the bitter pith) and add to
the bottle.

Add the cloves and the sugar.

Top up with gin to an inch below the top.

Leave the bottle in a prominent place for a few days and shake every
morning and evening to dissolve the sugar.

After a week place the bottle in a cool, dry place for three years.
