Lentil and Sausage Casserole

- 1 lb good quality pork sausages (85%+ meat); can be italian or toulouse
- 250g puy lentils (or green or brown lentils)
- 1/2 onion
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 can tomatoes
- 1 bay leaf
- 80g pancetta

Brown the sausages, then brown the pancetta in a tablespoon of oil.  Over a medium/low heat, sweat the onions until translucent, then add the garlic for 1 minute.

Add the tomatoes, bay leaf and lentils, and add extra boiling water to cover.

Bring to a simmer and cook over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until the lentils are done, by which time the sausages should also be done.  If you prefer the sausages can be served whole, or cut into 1-2" slices.
