This is the Nestl&eacute; recipe, as interpreted by [www.cookingforengineers.com](www.cookingforengineers.com).

- (280 - 360)g flour (the less flour, the softer the cookie)
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 340g chocolate chips
- 220g butter
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 150g sugar
- 165g brown sugar
- optional - 1 cup of mixed chopped nuts

Mix flour, salt and baking powder.  Separately, mix the butter, sugars and vanilla; then mix in the eggs.  Then mix in the flour mix.  Finally, stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts).  I prefer hand cut 70% plain chocolate chips; this is quite a high quantity, and anywhere from 250g up gives adequate results.

Drop dessertspoon-fulls of the mix onto a baking sheet, well separated.  This will make a cookie store sized cookie.  You can use a tablespoon, but if you aren't careful the results will be too big.  A batch is around 30 cookies.

Bake for 10 minutes at 375F.
