- 1 chicken, or equivalent in chicken pieces (4 thighs works for this).
- 1 cup rice (I use a 10 fl oz cup)
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 onion
- 4 - 6 oz mushrooms

Brown the chicken in a saut√© pan, using one or two tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil.  Continue to cook the chicken until it is almost done, which will take about 15-25 minutes, depending on the heat and thickness of the pieces.  Put the chicken to one side, and drain off excess oil.  Slightly soften the onion for about 2 minutes, then add the sliced mushrooms.  Cook for about one minute, then add the rice, and cook slightly for a further minute in the oil.  Add the hot stock and return the chicken pieces to the pan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and cook for about 15 - 20 minutes until the stock is mostly absorbed, the rice nicely cooked and the chicken thoroughly cooked.  You can do this stage on top of the burner or in a hot oven, as you prefer. Stir in some chopped parsley and serve.

You can consider adding garlic with the stock, or a teaspoon of paprika to dust the chicken before frying.
