## Ingredients

- Four 1-pint canning jars with lids and rings
- 2 cups unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1 cup distilled white vinegar
- 2 packed cups dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup kosher salt
- 2 1/2 pounds firm-but-ripe plums, pitted and cut into eight wedges each
- 8 cloves
- 4 star anise pods
- One 2-inch cinnamon stick, broken into 4 pieces
- 2 teaspoons pink peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds

## Directions

Fill a large pot with water, cover and bring to a boil. Add the
canning jars, lids and rings along with a set of tongs and a ladle and
simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes to sterilize. Cover the pot
and turn off the heat.

Set a metal rack in another large pot. Fill the pot with water, cover
and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine both vinegars with the brown sugar
and salt and bring to a boil to dissolve. Using the sterilized tongs,
remove the jars from the hot water and transfer them to a rimmed
baking sheet.

Pack the plums, cloves, star anise, cinnamon, peppercorns and fennel
seeds into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch at the top. Ladle the hot brine
over the plums, stopping 1/2 inch from the top. Using the tongs, screw
the lids and rings on the jars securely but not too tightly.

Using canning tongs, lower the jars onto the rack in the boiling
water, making sure they are covered by 1 inch of water. Boil over high
heat for 20 minutes. Using the canning tongs, transfer the jars to a
rack to cool until the lids seal (they will be concave); refrigerate
any jars that do not seal. Store the sealed jars in a cool, dark place
for up to 6 months.

## Notes

Inspired by li hing mui --salty-sweet dried plums that are a popular
snack in China-- chef Minh Phan pickles fresh plums in a salty-sweet
spiced brine. She suggests serving the plums in a refreshing soda made
by mixing them with their pickling liquid and sparkling water; garnish
with a sprig of Thai basil.

I make this reducing the salt by a lot, and serve with cold meats.
