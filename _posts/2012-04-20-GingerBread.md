Modified from Delia's Book of Cakes.

- 12 oz plain flour
- 1\.5 tsp ground ginger
- 2 level tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 nutmeg, grated

- 1 level tsp bicarb
- 4 tbs milk

- 6 oz treacle
- 6 oz golden syrup
- 6 oz dark brown soft sugar
- 6 oz butter
- 5 fl oz water

- 2 eggs

Sift flour and spices.  Mix bicarb into the milk in a separate container.  Put treacle, syrup, sugar and butter with 5 fl oz water into a medium saucepan and heat till the butter is melted and it is all well mixed.

Mix the melted ingredients into the flour mix.  Beat in the eggs, then finally the milk/bicarb.  It's ok to use an electric mixer for this, especially if the flour has formed lumps in the mix.  The bicarb will start reacting as soon as it is added, so leave this to last, and put into the tin and the oven as soon as the bicarb mix is in: don't let it hang around.  It is  contact with the treacle that causes the reaction.

Put into a greased and lined 2 lb loaf tin.  Bake for 75 - 90 minutes at 170 C until done - the top will be springy to touch, and the sides will have come away slightly from the tin.

This recipe makes a little too much mixture for the recommended tin.  I would suggest putting 2/3 the amount into the same tin, and using the rest in a small baking tray or small loaf tin, perhaps.  It would work in a deep 8" round cake tin, but is too much for an 8" square tin!
