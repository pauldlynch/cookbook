Recipe adapted from Edouarde de Pomiane.

- 600g beef; chuck, shin, brisket, even silverside or top rump will do.
- 6oz fat bacon
- 1 onion
- sprig fresh thyme
- bay leaf
- half bottle red wine

In a casserole, melt a spoonful of butter over medium heat, and add the bacon.  This should have been chopped into cubes, small or large (1cm) will both work.  When it has rendered some fat and started to brown, add the chopped onion.  Cook slowly until this, too, has started to brown.  Add the beef, which should have been chopped into 1" cubes, and turn up the heat.  The beef is likely to give up a lot of liquid, but you want it to brown quickly, so browning in a separate, larger pan is an option.

Add the herbs, then the wine, and season (a very small teaspoon of salt, depending on the bacon, and a good grating of black pepper); bring to a simmer, then put on a well fitting lid and put in a medium low oven (160C) for 3 hours.

Half an hour before the end, give a gentle stir (as the meat may well break up), and top up with water, stock or wine as preferred.  Five minutes before serving, add a small glass of brandy, and drop in small chunks (nut sized) of beurre mani√©.  This is made by working together a spoonful of plain flour with one of butter.  Use a whisk, or vigourous action with a fork, to mix this in with the juices.  This should thicken the liquid and give it a glossy sheen.  An alternative is to strain off the juices, and reduce separately in a saucepan.

A traditional garnish would be to add baby onions and small mushrooms towards the end (they will need 30-40 minutes cooking in the juices).

Serve.  I like boiled or rough mashed potatoes and greens or broad beans with this.
