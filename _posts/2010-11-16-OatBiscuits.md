Flakemeal biscuits, from Margaret Bates 'Talking About Cakes'.  I have never seen flakemeal available, but normal rolled oats or oatmeal produce excellent results.

- 8 oz butter (2 sticks)
- 4 oz sugar (4 tbs)
- 4 oz plain flour (4 tbs)
- 10 oz oats or oatmeal (3 cups)
- 1 tsp salt
- pinch baking soda

Cream the butter and sugar.  Mix in the rest of the ingredients.  Roll out on a floured board to roughly the thickness of a pound coin, and cut into biscuit shapes.  Bake for 20-25 minutes at 375F, or until golden brown.
