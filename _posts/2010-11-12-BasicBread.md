Bread is flour, water, salt and yeast.  For a given weight of flour, you want to have between 60% and 70% of the weight of flour as water, and 2% salt.  Wetter dough makes nicer bread, but it also tends to spread out if you don't have it in a strict container, so you need a drier dough for a free-form loaf.  The exact amount of water required is dependent on the flour you are using, you can only really test it by feel.

I didn't mention yeast.  This is because you can use a sourdough starter, a small amount of yeast with a longer rising time, or a lot more yeast with a shorter time - the longer the rise the better the end product will taste.

To make a small loaf, free-form or in a bread tin for a beginner:

- 1 lb/450g bread flour (you can use plain flour)
- 1 sachet/7g active dried yeast
- 270-300g water
- 1/2 tsp salt

Start with very clean hands, or your dough will be grey!

Use hand hot water, not hot and not cold.  Sprinkle on the yeast and stir it to dissolve.  Mix in the flour and salt in a bowl or on a very clear work surface; it should come to a pliable, smooth dough.  You may need to add a little water to reach this point (I gave the lower amounts of water above).  Knead very carefully for ten minutes (I use the oven timer); this means stretch the dough in your hands or on the surface, fold the stretch back, turn 1/4 of a turn, and repeat.  This is meant to be hard work.  Over the course of the kneading, the bread will go from being very sticky and friable, to being only slightly sticky and very stretchy.

Put the dough in a clean bowl, cover with a cloth, and leave for an hour in a warm room.  It should double in size, although this is very hard to estimate, so don't worry too much about precise sizes.

Gather up the dough in your hands and give it a few (three or four) turns of kneading.  This will flatten it down, but won't entirely collapse the dough.

What you do next depends on how you want to use the dough: a loaf of bread, flat breads, or pizza.  But no matter which, heat your oven to its highest temperature - probably 450C.  This will almost certainly take 20 minutes or longer to come up to temperature.

For a loaf, just shape it, put it into a loaf tin or free-form on a baking sheet, and make a cut 1cm deep the length of the loaf (you can make pretty patterns if you want).  You can dust it with flour, cornmeal, or brush the loaf with milk or egg wash before cutting if you wish.  Put the loaf in the oven for approximately 45 minutes.

For flat bread, divide the dough into 4-6 equal portions.  Stretch each one out to about 8" long (20-25cm), and put directly on the top shelf of the oven for about six to eight minutes.  The bread will puff up into a sphere.

For pizza, divide as for flat bread, but stretch out more; this will need some time resting and restretching, as the dough will pull itself back as it rests.  Let the dough sit on a baking sheet for ten minutes.  Then top with 2-3 tomatoes (from a tin, without their juice), pulled apart by hand to make a rough coverage over the top of the dough.  Top this with a few slices of mozzarella and a couple of basil leaves, and bake for roughly ten minutes.
