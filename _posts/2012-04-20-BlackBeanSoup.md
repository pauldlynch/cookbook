- 150g black beans
- 80g pancetta
- 1/2 onion
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 dried chilli
- 1/2 can tomatoes

Soak the beans overnight (or use a couple of tins!).  Boil well covered with water for ten minutes, then simmer for another 30 minutes.

Brown the pancetta in a tablespoon of oil, then over a low heat soften the onion.  When translucent, add the garlic and chilli.  After 30 seconds, add the drained beans, tomatoes and water to cover.  Simmer until the beans are very soft, and some are bursting.  Blend half and return to the pan.  Season.

Serve in bowls with side dishes of green coriander, sour cream, grated cheese (cheddar), plus optional salsa and guacamole.
