This is a slightly darker, Spanish/Italian style nougat.

- 450g/1lb sugar
- 250g/9oz liquid glucose
- 200g/7oz honey
- 2 egg whites
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 100-150g/3.5-5oz pistachio kernels
- 100-150g/3.5-5oz blanched and toasted almonds

3 sheets rice paper

20cm/8in cake tin

Line the tin with rice paper.  

Put sugar, glucose and honey in a wide pan over a low heat and dissolve.  Cook to 130C/266F (hard crack).

Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks.  Slowly pour in half the syrup while whisking.  Add the vanilla extract and continue to whisk.

Heat the remaining syrup to 150C/302F (that's the edge of caramel), then pour into the mix (while beating).  Whisk to thick and glossy - about 5 mins.  Fold in the nuts.

Pour into tin.  Cover with a second sheet of rice paper.  Cool and cut.
