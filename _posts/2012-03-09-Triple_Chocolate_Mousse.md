1.  The Flourless Chocolate Cake

- 7oz bittersweet chocolate (70%)
- 6 tbs unsalted butter
- 3/4 tsp instant espresso powder

Put over a bain-marie and mix until smooth.  Allow to cool for 5 mins.

Butter a 9" springform pan (at least 3" high).

Separate 4 large eggs.  Mix yolks into the chocolate mixture, then add 1.5 tsp vanilla extract.

Beat the whites with a pinch of salt for 30s at medium, until colour changes to white and is starting to be frothy with large bubbles.  Add 1/6 cup (1.2 oz) light brown sugar, beat 15 secs on medium.  Then 1/6 cup (1.2 oz) light brown sugar, beat at high to soft peaks, up to 1 minute more (times are with a stand mixer; electric mixer will be 2-3 times longer, hand whisk a lot more than this).

Mix the whites into the chocolate mixture, the first 1/3 with a whisk, then 2/3 folded in gently with a spatula.

Bake at 325F/160C, 13-18 minutes, maybe a little longer.  Firm at edges, just rebound in centre.  Cool for at least 1 hour; it will drop a little.

2. Chocolate Mousse

Melt over simmering water.  Allow to cool for 2 mins before whisking in 2 tbs cocoa powder, first mixed with 5 tbs hot water.

Spoon over the cake (still in the pan), tap a couple of times on the counter to remove large bubbles.  Then smooth the top with a palette knife, and clean the edges.  Put in fridge for >15 mins.
