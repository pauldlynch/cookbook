## Ingredients

- 4 Aubergines, each weighing about 275g
- 6 tbsp olive oil
- 1 Medium onion finely chopped
- 4 Garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 Large red pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1.5 tsp Freshly ground cumin seeds
- 1 tsp Ground cinnamon
- 0.5 tsp Freshly ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp Pimentón dulce (smoked sweet Spanish paprika)
- 1 Large pinch of crushed dried chillies
- 500 g (17.6oz) Minced lamb
- 6 tbsp Tomato sauce (ideally freshly made)
- 100 g (3.5oz) Manchego cheese, coarsely grated
- 1 Good pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6. Cut each aubergine length-ways
   through the stalk, then score the flesh in a tight criss-cross
   pattern, taking the knife through the flesh down to the skin, but
   taking care not to cut through the skin. Place them side by side on
   a baking tray and drizzle each half with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil,
   season with salt and bake for about 30 minutes or until the flesh
   is soft and tender but not browned.

2. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large
   non-stick frying pan. Add the onion, garlic, red pepper and spices
   and fry gently for 10 minutes. Add the minced lamb and fry for 3-4
   minutes or until all the meat is lightly browned. Stir in the
   tomato sauce and leave to simmer for 5 minutes.

3. Remove the aubergines from the oven and increase the temperature to
   220°C/gas 7. Using a dessertspoon, carefully scoop most of the
   flesh out of the baked aubergine halves, leaving the skins with a
   layer of flesh about 1cm thick. Stir the flesh into the lamb
   mixture with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and some pepper to taste. Spoon
   the mixture into each aubergine shell and sprinkle with the grated
   cheese. Bake for 9-10 minutes until golden brown.
