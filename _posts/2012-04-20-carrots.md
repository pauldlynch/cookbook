- 2 large carrots, or six small ones
- large teaspoon sugar
- large teaspoon unsalted butter

- small saucepan
- knife

Top and tail the carrots; peel only if they need it - use a peeler, or just scrape with the side of a knife.  Slice into 1 cm slices (or a little thinner if preferred).

Put the carrots into a small saucepan with the butter and sugar; barely cover with water (no salt).  Bring to the boil; watch while the water boils away, about 5 minutes.  There should still be liquid remaining at the bottom of the pan when the carrots are done.

The sugar, butter and remaining water will make a sauce for the carrots.  Serve as they are, or top with a teaspoon of chopped parsley.
