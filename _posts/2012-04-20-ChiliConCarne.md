- 750g best mince (lean steak)
- 2 red chilis
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tin (400g) mixed beans or red kidney
- 1 tin red kidney beans in chili sauce
- 1 tin (400g) tomatoes
- 1 onion
- 2 red peppers
- stock to cover
- 1 tbs flour

First, brown all the mince in small batches in a very hot pan, with the windows open and smoke detector turned off.

In a hot casserole, with a tbs oil, add the cumin and brown for a minute or until the aroma rises.  Then add the onion and turn down the heat to sweat for a few minutes.  Add the chopped chilis for a minute, then add the flour, then the mince, and the contents of the three cans, and sufficient stock to well cover.

Separately, deseed the peppers and place, cut side down, in a grill pan.  Put under a very hot grill and burn the skins.  Allow to cool, then remove the skins and cut into strips.  Stir into the chili ten minutes before serving.

Serve with rice and grated cheese.

Variations: add a tsp of smoked (hot) paprika, or a couple of squares of 70% chcocolate, or a tsp ground cinnamon.  I would consider trying a mix of beef and pork mince, or adding a chunk of slow roasted pork, pulled apart into threads.  It's tricky to get the heat adjusted right; it makes a lot of sense to use chili powder of known heat to taste rather than fresh chilis, but I like to use a mix of different types of dried chili for a more interesting flavour.
