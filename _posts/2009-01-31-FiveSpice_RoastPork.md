Make a marinade from:

- 1 tbs five spice powder;
- 100 ml soy sauce;
- 100 ml dry sherry (or a suitable substitute);
- a 1in cube of fresh root ginger, finely chopped;
- 2-3 cloves of garlic;
- 1 finely chopped chili;
- 50 ml or so light oil.

Take a 800 g piece of pork loin, and put in in the marinade.  Rub the marinade well in; and make deep cuts through the meat and push in the marinade.  This needs about 1 - 2 hours.  You might choose to rub the meat with the five spice mix seperately, and make the marinade from the rest of the ingredients.

Roast for 2 hours at 160 C; then let rest for 15 minutes.  You can make a gravy by adding 500 ml of boiling water to the roasting pan over a hot plate and stirring around; there is likely to be a fair amount of fat from the pork that should be poured off.  This gravy shouldn't be thickened.

Serve with plain boiled rice and stir-fried/steamed pak choi, cabbage, etc.
