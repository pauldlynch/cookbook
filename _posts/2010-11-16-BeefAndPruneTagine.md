From Moro (Casa Moro), via the Telegraph.  For four.

- 40g butter
- 2 tbs olive oil
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped (3 tbs)
- 4 tbs chopped fresh coriander
- large pinch saffron, soaked in 2 tbs hot water
- 1\.2 kg stewing beef, well trimmed  (seems too much)

- 400g prunes, soaked in cold water
- 2 tbs honey

To finish:

- 1 tbs toasted sesame seeds
- 4 tbs chopped fresh coriander
- 180g almonds, toasted in olive oil to golden

Start by soaking the prunes and the saffron.

Heat the butter and oil over medium to high heat to foaming; add ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, onion and coriander. Fry for 30 seconds, then add the beef and thoroughly coat (about 1-2 minutes).

Add the saffron and cover with water.  Bring to a simmer, then add half the prunes.  Cook for 90 minutes.

Add honey and the rest of the prunes and season (salt).  Simmer uncovered for another 30 minutes.  The sauce should reduce and thicken over this time.

Server with more chopped fresh coriander, almonds and some toasted sesame seeds.
