Adjusted from [a recipe in the Telegraph for "Almondines"](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/8946631/Cake-recipe-Edd-Kimbers-almondines.html). 

Makes 12 - in a 12 hole muffin tin.

Crumble:

- 4 oz / 120g plain flour
- 3 oz / 80g demerara sugar
- 3 oz / 80g unsalted butter

Fragipane:

- 3\.5 oz / 100g unsalted butter
- 3\.5 oz / 100g caster sugar
- 3\.5 oz /  100g ground almonds
- 1 egg
- 2 oz / 50g cornflour
= drops of almond extract

Filling:

- 2/3 jar mincemeat
- zest 1 orange
- 2 tbs brandy
- 1 tbs grated ginger

Alternate filling is damson or plum jam.

180C oven.  Make up the crumble by mixing sugar and flour, then rubbing in the butter.

For the frangipane, beat the butter and sugar, then mix in the ground almonds, followed by the egg and almond extract.  Fold in the cornflour.

Put a spoonful of frangipane in each muffin hole and smooth it our to cover the bottom.  Add a smallish spoonful of mincemeat/jam in the middle, then cover with the crumble.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the crumble is lightly browned and the frangipane is clean to a cocktail stick.
