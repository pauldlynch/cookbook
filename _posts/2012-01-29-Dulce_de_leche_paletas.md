makes 4

- 1 cup (8 fl oz) single cream
- 1/4 cup dulce de leche (about half a can of condensed milk, boiled)
- pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup chopped nuts, walnuts or pecans (optional)

Mix the ingredients; you may need to add some sugar (50g) to the cream and heat to dissolve, depending on your dulce de leche (boil a can of condensed milk for a couple of hours - VERY IMPORTANT - unopened).

Put the nuts, if using, into the moulds first.

Put the mix into moulds and freeze for 1-2 hours, then insert the wooden sticks.  This is so that they stay vertical and don't sink to the bottom (or float to the top).

Finish freezing, total time is probably about 4-5 hours.  If you try to take them out too soon, the stick may come out on its own.  Run them under a tap for a few seconds to help them release from the moulds.
