- 450g italian sausages, or pork mince plus seasonings (fennel seed, onion, garlic)
- 450g beef mince
- 1 handful fresh breadcrumbs
- 1 handful grated parmesan
- 1 tbs chopped parsley

- 1 clove garlic
- 1 red chilli or 1 tsp crushed chilli
- 1 small onion
- 1 small carrot
- 1 stick celery
- 1 tsp dried herbs (oregano)
- 1 tsp tomato puree
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 jar passata
- 1 glass red wine

Soften the finely chopped onion, carrot and celery in a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.  When soft, which will take around ten minutes, add the crushed garlic and finely chopped chilli for about one minute.  Add the herbs, tomato pur√©e, sugar and passata.  Bring to a simmer.

While the sauce is cooking, assemble the ingredients for the meatballs and roll into small meatballs - somewhere between the size of a large marble and a golf ball (depending on how big your marbles are, that might be the right size).  The ingredients above should make 20 - 30 meatballs. Brown with a little oil.  When the meatballs are all nicely browned, add to the sauce, and deglaze the pan with the red wine and add to the sauce.

Keep at a simmer for 40 minutes to 90 minutes.  Serve with tagliatelle, spaghetti, etc; or use to make a sub (one sub roll, lightly toasted, one side with cheese; add meatballs and a small amount of sauce).
