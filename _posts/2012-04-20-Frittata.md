Serves 4; taken from a Sainsbury's magazine and adapted.

- 100 g pancetta (or unsmoked bacon, chorizo, etc)
- 1 onion (sweet or red), chopped
- 1 medium waxy potato (red skin) or 2-3 small ones
- 10 large eggs
- 2 tbs parmesan

Requires an 8" non-stick frying pan, or considerable talent and a well-seasoned cast iron pan.  The size is important, as you want to have a height of 1.5" - 2.5" when all is assembled.  Classically this can be made with just eggs, potato and possibly onion.

Basic method: boil the potatoes; they should be, in anything, slightly underdone to just done, and quite firm.  Fry the pancetta/chorizo in 1 tbs olive oil.  When starting to brown (maybe 5 minutes), add some more oil, the onion, and the sliced potato (the thickness of a pound coin).  Cook for 5-10 minutes over a low to medium heat; the onion should not brown.

You can add a red pepper at this stage, if you like - I prefer mine to be skinned.  Other options include a handful of frozen peas, sweetcorn, mushrooms, asparagus, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomatoes, etc.

Add the whisked eggs and reduce the heat to low.  Cook to almost set, but try to avoid the bottom burning - this involves some fine juggling.  Sprinkle with the parmesan, and grill for 3-4 minutes.

An alternative is to bake in an oven at 350F for 20 minutes, and add the parmesan halfway through.  But decidedly non-traditional.
