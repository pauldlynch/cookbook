This is my translation of Poulet Sauté au Vinaigre, courtesy of Michel Guérard, via Simon Hopkinson.

- 1 chicken, jointed into 8
- 2 oz butter
- 6 skinned and deseeded tomatoes (aka one can)
- 300 ml red wine vinegar (best quality)
- 300 ml chicken stock
- 2 oz butter
- 1 tbs chopped parsley

Season the chicken, and fry in the first butter in a sauté pan that can hold all of the parts until golden brown.  Add the tomato, and cook until almost dry and quite dark red.  Add the vinegar, and cook until almost dry - the objective is to drive off almost all of the acetic acid, but retain the flavour.  Add the stock, simmer and reduce by half.  Stir in the butter to enrich the sauce, and serve with boiled potatoes and garnished with the parsley.
