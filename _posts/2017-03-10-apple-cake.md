Borrowed from [Felicity's Perfect Dorset Apple Cake](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/oct/13/how-to-cook-the-perfect-dorset-apple-cake).

## Ingredients

- 225g wholemeal flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- Grating of nutmeg or 1 tsp mixed spice
- 175g light muscovado sugar
- 150g butter, melted
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 4 medium apples, preferably fairly tangy (I like Coxâ€™s), diced
- Demerara sugar, to top
- 2 tbsp flaked almonds

## Directions

Heat the oven to 160C and grease a 20cm cake tin. Put the flour,
baking powder, salt, nutmeg and sugar in a large bowl and stir in the
butter and eggs. Beat together for a minute or so until well combined.

Stir in the apples until well distributed, then spoon into the
tin. Smooth the top and then sprinkle with the demerara. Bake for an
hour, then add the almonds and bake for about 15-25 minutes more until
coming away from the tin.

Allow to cool for 10 minutes in the tin then lift onto a rack to cool
completely.
