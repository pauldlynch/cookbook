Horchata is one of the Mexican agua frescas (and this is the Mexican, not the Spanish, version).  The other two big flavours that you will see everywhere are tamarindo and jamaica (hibiscus).

- 1\.5 - 2 litres rice milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 80g sugar

Mix, chill.  Serve over ice.

Using rice milk is the quick way.  If you don't have access to it, the traditional method is easy, and may give better results:

- 250g uncooked rice (long grain, but it doesn't really matter)
- 1\.2 litre water
- 120 ml milk

Break down the rice in a blender for about one to two minutes.  It doesn't have to be a powder, large lumps will still remain.  It may be easiest to add the water first; if not, add the water and leave overnight (at least 3 hours).  strain out the rice and add the milk when you are ready to make it up.

Options:  you can add a few drops of almond essence.  Make an alcoholic drink by mixing with rum.  A number of authentic recipes use condensed/evaporated milk instead of real milk (and with the sweetened version you can omit the sugar).
