I think this may be a Nigella recipe, or it may have come from a magazine.

##Ingredients

Serves 6  
Prep 15 min  
Cook 40 min  

- 150g dark, bitter chocolate 
- 125g butter 
- 3 eggs 
- 150g sugar 
- 150g self-raising flour, sifted 
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract



##METHOD

Heat the oven to 180C/Gas 4. Lightly butter a 20 x 10cm loaf tin. Combine the chocolate with the butter in a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir until smooth then remove from the heat. Beat together the eggs and sugar until thick and creamy. Fold in the flour, vanilla extract and chocolate. Pour into the tin and bake for 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, then turn out and leave to go cold.

Comment: you want this to finish with the middle still gooey, which is not what you normally intend for a cake.  If you do bake it for too long, so that the centre is dry, it will be decidedly boring.  Chocolatey, but still boring.
