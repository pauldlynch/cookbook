This is an American version of a Yorkshire pudding or clafoutis.  The
intention is to have the batter swell up into a globe shape in cooking.

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 1 cup (230 ml) milk
- 1 cup (130 g) plain flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- ¾ tsp salt
- ¼ cup (60 g) unsalted butter
- fruit preserves (jam)
- powdered sugar
- maple syrup

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425F (220C).

Whisk eggs, milk, flour, sugar and salt in a blender. Place butter in
a large cast iron pan and melt in the hot oven. Remove pan and swirl
butter around to coat sides.

Pour batter atop melted butter and bake on lowest rack until golden
brown, 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately with powdered sugar,
preserves, or classic maple syrup.
