- 3 oz/85g chocolate
- 10\.75 oz/305g plain flour
- 2 tsp/12g baking soda
- 1 tsp/6g salt

- 3 large/150g eggs
- 1\.5 tsp/7g vanilla extract

- 4 oz/115g butter
- 13\.5 oz/385g brown sugar

- 8 oz/230g sour cream
- 8 oz/230g boiling water

Heat oven to 350F/175C and prepare a 9" cake tin (line with greaseproof paper, 3" deep). Pulse dry ingredients (pulverise chocolate first, then flour, etc) in a food processor.  Lightly beat the eggs and vanilla.

Cream the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl, then blend in the eggs, then finally the sour cream and dry ingredients.  This will be a stiff mixture.  Gradually mix in the boiling water, forming a (very) loose mixture.

Bake 30 mins at 350F/175C, then 30 at 300F/150C.  Internal temperature should reach 175-180F (80C), which will still be sticky in the middle.  Cool for 15 mins, remove to rack and allow to cool completely.  Split into 3 layers for frosting.  Alternate - will make up to 2 dozen cupcakes (15-20 minutes at 350F/175C) - 3/4 fill the moulds.

## Chocolate Frosting

- 6\.5 oz/180g chocolate
- 4 oz/115g whipping cream
- 8 oz/227g butter
- 10 oz/285g icing sugar
- bowl of ice

Melt butter, chocolate and cream over medium heat, stirring until smooth.  Beat in icing sugar, then continue to beat over ice until frosting lightens and holds its shape.
