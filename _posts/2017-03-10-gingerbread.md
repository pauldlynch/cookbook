## Ingredients

- 4oz/115g butter
- 3oz/85g treacle
- 3oz/85g golden syrup
- 5 fl oz/150ml milk
- 12oz/340g plain flour
- 2 tsp ginger
- 2 tsp mixed spice
- Pinch salt
- 4oz/115g demerara sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp bicarb (aka baking soda)

## Directions

From George & Cecelia Scurfield, modified to be more like mum's.

Set oven to 175C. Select either a 2 lb loaf tin, or a 12" x 9" baking
tray.

Melt butter, milk, treacle and syrup in a saucepan; don't let it get
too hot.  If it does, allow enough time to cool; you don't want to
scramble the eggs.

Sieve flour and spices together; add sugar and stir to combine. Pour
in the melted liquids from the saucepan, and mix well. Add the eggs,
lightly beaten. Dissolve the bicarb in a little milk (a couple of
tablespoonfuls), add and mix well, then put in your pan and into the
oven directly, as the bicarb will start to work as soon as it is mixed
in.

Bake at 350F/175C for 1 - 1.5 hours in loaf tin, or 20 - 25 minutes in
a 12”x9” tray. Best left in cake tin for a day or two.

Options: combine cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, nutmeg for mixed
spice. To create a substitute for mixed spice, try 1.5 tsp ginger, 1.5
cinnamon, 0.25 cloves, 1/8 nutmeg/mace. Could try extra golden syrup,
or swap with a light honey or agave nectar; the treacle is required to
activate the bicarb.
