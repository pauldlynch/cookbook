## Ingredients

- 12oz/340g plain flour
- 4oz/115g demerara sugar
- 4oz/115g butter
- 3oz/85g treacle
- 3oz/85g golden syrup
- 2 eggs
- 5 fl oz/150ml milk
- 2 tsp ginger
- 2 tsp mixed spice
- Pinch salt
- 1 tsp bicarb (aka baking soda)

## Directions

From George & Cecelia Scurfield, modified to be more like mum's.

Mix melted butter, milk, treacle and syrup. Sieve flour, spices; add
sugar. Mix with liquid. Add beaten eggs. Dissolve bicarb in a little
milk and add.

Bake at 350F/175C for 1 - 1.5 hours in loaf tin. Seemed ok after 25
mins in a 12”x9” tray. Best left in cake tin for a day or two.

Options: cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, nutmeg for mixed
spice. To create a substitute for mixed spice, try 1.5 tsp ginger, 1.5
cinnamon, 0.25 cloves, 1/8 nutmeg/mace. Could try extra golden syrup,
or swap with a light honey or agave nectar.
