- 1 can chick peas
- 1 clove garlic
- 4 tbs tahini
- juice of half a lemon
- 1/2 tsp salt

This really needs a blender.  Drain the chick peas, put all the ingredients into the blender, and blend to a smooth paste.  Season to taste. Add some water or reserved cooking liquid to adjust the texture.

The details: you can used dried chick peas; they will need to be soaked overnight and cooked for anywhere from 40 minutes up, but probably closer to 90, depending mainly on the age of the beans.  Use plenty of water, and, as with all beans, cook at a fast boil for the first ten minutes.  There will probably be some membraneous skins that need removal before blending.

Raw garlic is very powerful and strong flavoured.  Start with a small clove, finely chopped.  You can blend it by pulverising with some coarse salt.

If you don't like tahini, don't use it - but then it's not really hummus, and I like lots of tahini.  Tahini settles in its jar and forms a hard paste under some oil; try to mix it well before using.

If the hummus is too thin, often adding a small amount of water will make it thicker.  Strange but true.

Serve on a flat dish or plate, with a topping of good quality olive oil, and a pinch of sumac.
