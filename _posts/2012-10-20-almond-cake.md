Via [David Lebovitz](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2010/06/almond-cake-recipe/); adapted from Chez Panisse Desserts by Lindsey Remolif Shere.  I have adapted it to use marzipan instead of almond paste, which is far more obtainable in the UK.  For experimenters, marzipan is roughly 66% sugars/33% almond, whereas almond paste is 50%/50%.

Requires one 9-inch (at least 2" high) or 10-inch (23-25 cm) cake; alternatively you can bake this quantity in 2  x 2lb loaf tins.  This keeps very well for at least a week (in a cake tin/Tupperware).

This recipe is unusual in that it is intended to be best made using a food processor, although this is mainly to get the right texture when breaking down the almond paste/marzipan.

The original recipe (Shere's) used an extra 55g butter, which makes a heavier, almost an up-class GBC (Gooey Butter Cake) recipe.  There should be no problem reverting to 280g/10oz butter if you wish.

- 150g sugar (or 265g sugar, using almond paste)
- 340g marzipan (or 225g/8oz almond paste)
- 105g plain flour (plus 35g - total is 140g)
- 225g unsalted butter, room temperature, in small cubes
- 1\.5 teaspoons baking powder
- 0\.75 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature

1. Set the oven to 160C/325F, and prepare the pan: butter, then shake a spoonful of flour and tip out, then bottom line.  If you use a loaf tin, you can use a U-shaped parchment lining.

2. In the bowl of a food processor, grind the sugar, almond paste, and 1/4 cup (35g) of flour until the almond paste is finely ground and the mixture resembles sand.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3/4 cup (105g) of flour, baking powder, and salt.

4. Once the almond paste is completely broken up, add the cubes of butter and the vanilla and almond extracts, then process until the batter is very smooth and fluffy.

5. Add the eggs one at a time, processing a bit before the next addition. (You may wish to open the machine and scrape the sides down to make sure the eggs are getting fully incorporated.)

After you add all the eggs, the mixture may look curdled. Don’t worry; it’ll come back together after the next step.

6. Add half the flour mixture and pulse the machine a few times, then add the rest, pulsing the machine until the drying ingredients are just incorporated, but do not overmix. (You can also transfer the batter to a bowl and mix the dry ingredients in, which ensures the dry ingredients get incorporated evenly and you don’t overbeat it.)

7. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake the cake for 65 minutes, or until the top is deep brown and feels set when you press in the center.

8. Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp or serrated knife around the perimeter, loosing the cake from the sides of the pan. Let the cake cool completely in the pan.

Once cool, tap the cake out of the pan, remove the parchment paper, and set on a cake plate until ready to serve. (Tip: Warm the bottom of the cake pan directly on the stovetop for just a few seconds, which will help the cake release.)
