From Delia Smith, modified.

- 450g bread (or cake) flour
- 1 packet active yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 tsp mixed spice
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 50g caster sugar
- 50g unsalted butter
- 225 ml warm milk
- 1 large egg
- 110g currants/raisin/sultanas
- 50g cut mixed peel

Mix the yeast in with the milk.  Sift/stir together the flour, salt,
sugar and spice.  Beat the egg into the milk and make a dough by
adding the milk mixture to the flour and butter.  The butter will
quickly soften and knead in.  Continue to knead for up to ten minutes;
it should come together to a smooth dough after between 4 and 6
minutes, but could take longer.  Spread it out flat on a floured
surface, and evenly spread the fruit and peel, then roll up, give a
couple of turns of kneading, and shape into a ball.

Cover and leave to rise for about 2 hours in a warm place.  If it
hasn't obviously risen to about double, leave it until it has.  Divide
into 12 equal sized pieces (of about 80g each), and arrange on a
greased baking tray.  Spacing should be about one inch between; as
they rise they may stick together, which is fine. You should leave
them to rise to double before putting in the oven.

If you want to have a cross (I don't usually), mix some flour and
water to a thin paste, and paint on the top of each bun at this point.

Bake in a preheated hot oven at 425F/220C, turn down to 375F/190C
after a couple of minutes.  Total baking time should be about 15-20
minutes.  When they are done the tops will have completely darkened,
to a light/medium caramel colour.

Glaze with 25g sugar dissolved in 50 ml (2 tbs) water, brought to a
boil to make a syrup. Do this while they are still warm from the oven.
