From Delia Smith, modified.

- 450g bread flour
- 1 packet active yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 65g caster sugar
- 50g unsalted butter
- 200 ml warm milk
- 1 large egg
- 90g currants/raisin/sultanas
- 60g cut mixed peel

Mix the yeast in with the milk.  Sift/stir together the flour, salt, sugar and spice.  Beat the egg into the milk and make a dough with the flour and butter.  The butter will quickly knead in.  Continue to knead for up to ten minutes; it should come together to a smooth dough after between 4 and 6 minutes, but could take longer.  Spread it out flat on a surface, and evenly spread the fruit and peel, then roll up, give a couple of turns of kneading, and shape into a ball.

Cover and leave to rise for about 1 hour in a warm place.  If it hasn't obviously risen to about double, leave it until it has.  Divide into 12 equal sized pieces (of about 80g each), and arrange on a greased baking tray.  Spacing should be about one inch between; as they rise they may stick together, which is fine.

Bake in a preheated hot oven at 425F, turn down to 375F after a couple of minutes.  Total baking time should be about 15-20 minutes.  When they are done the tops will have completely darkened, to a light/medium caramel colour.

Glaze with 25g sugar dissolved in 525 ml water, brought to a boil to make a syrup.
