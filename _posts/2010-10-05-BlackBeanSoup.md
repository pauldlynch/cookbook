##Ingredients

- 1 tbs oil
- 1 pack pancetta
- 1 onion
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 chili
- 2 tins black beans
- chicken stock
- garnish: coriander, cheese, sour cream, chili, chives, chopped spring onion, etc

##Equipment

- medium to large saucepan

##Method

Put the saucepan over a medium heat and chop the onion.  Add the oil and lightly brown the pancetta.  Sweat the onion with a pinch of salt; take care not to brown.  After about 5 minutes add the finely chopped garlic and chili; continue to cook for one more minute.

Add the beans and stock; make up to sufficient quantity (1 - 1.5 litres).  Bring to a simmer and leave for 10 - 20 minutes.  Roughly crush the beans with a liquidiser/magic wand; you want some lumps and whole beans left.  Check the seasoning and serve (will probably need 1 tsp salt).

Serve with an assortment of garnishes.  If you need more servings, add water/stock, and serve over a toasted crouton of a thick slice of good bread with that has been topped with cheese.

You can try this with stock cubes, even vegetarian (and omit the pancetta); use bacon instead of pancetta.  Use chili powder (about 1 tsp) instead of fresh chili.  Vary the garnishes, but the coriander makes a big difference.  Itâ€™s possible to make this work with different beans; you could try haricot/flageolet/borlotti/cannellini (white beans) with a handful of chopped cooked ham, add parsley instead of coriander, and reduce the amount of chili (1/4 tsp).
