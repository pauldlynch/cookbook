Adapted from Elizabeth David.

- 1/2 pt double cream
- 3 eggs
- 200g smoked bacon/lardons
- 50/75g cheese - I use mixed parmesan and medium/mature cheddar; a mix of parmesan/gruyere also works well.
- 1/2 pack shortcrust pastry

Roll out the pastry and line a 8"/9" pie/flan dish.  Bake blind for 15-20 mins.  This makes a deep (approx 1") tart on a 7"/8" tin, or about 1/2" on a 9"; both are pleasant, in their own way.

Cut the bacon into 1" strips, then gently sweat until starting to brown.  Put into the tart.

Gently beat and lightly season three eggs - don't over season, as the bacon will add some salt.  Mix in the cream and pour over the tart.  Scatter the grated cheese over the top.

Bake at 375F 30 minutes.  It is done when the centre is still a little wobbly; it will finish setting as it cools.

Variations: make your own pastry! Omit the cheese, which is a French/English addition.  Swap one or more eggs for egg yolks - I have seen recipes for the same quantity of cream with anything from 1 to 6 eggs, so the recipe is obviously flexible. The addition of any vegetables, or the reduction of the cream, is a heathen abomination.  You could try replacing half the cream with 100g of cream cheese or goats cheese, lightly crumbled into the mixture.
