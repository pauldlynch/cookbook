The origin of this, I believe, is the Joy of Cooking.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (180C)

Prepare streusel and set aside:

- 2/3 cup all-purpose flour (100g)
- 2/3 cup packed soft light brown sugar (165g)
- 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (100g)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted (90g)

Whisk together thoroughly and set aside:

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (300g)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Combine in another bowl and set aside:

- 1 1/4 cups sour cream (300 ml)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a large bowl, beat on high speed until lightened in colour and texture, 3-4 minutes:

- 4 tablespoons softened (but not oily) butter (60g)
- 1 cup caster sugar (200g)

Beat in one at a time:

- 2 large eggs

Add the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the sour cream mixture in 2 parts (therefore it goes 1/3 flour, 1/2 sour cream, 1/3 flour, 1/2 sour cream, 1/3 flour), beating on low speed and scraping the sides as necessary.  Spread into a greased 13x9 inch pan.  Sprinkle with streusel, starting with the edges.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Serve warm!  Although it gets better when left for a day.
