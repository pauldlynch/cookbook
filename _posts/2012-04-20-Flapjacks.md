- 125g unsalted butter
- 125g demerara sugar
- 5 tbs golden syrup
- 225g rolled oats
- 1 tsp ground ginger

melt butter and stir in sugar and syrup, then oats and ginger.

Press into a 20cm sandwich tin, or equivalent baking tray.

Bake for 20 mins at 190C/375F/gas mark 5.  Cool for 15 mins, and slice.

This comes out a little too syrupy for my taste, but is otherwise a good recipe.  I suspect that adjusting type of sugar and quantities of syrup will be required.  You can also vary the size of oats, and consider mixing a proportion of oatmeal instead of up to 50% of the oats.  Another option is to use muesli/granola instead of some of the oats.
