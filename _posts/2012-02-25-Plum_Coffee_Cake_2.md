[Plum Streusel Coffee Cake](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Plum-Streusel-Coffeecake-13137)


Streusel:

- 1 cup plain flour - 125g
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar - 100g
- 6 tbs butter - 85g
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts - 60g

Mix all except the walnuts until the texture is like breadcrumbs.  Stir in the walnuts, then gently squeeze in your hands so that the mixture clumps together, in a similar way to "bringing together" pastry.  You ideally want to end up with pea sized lumps of streusel on the cake.

Cake:

- 1/2 cup butter - 110g
- 3/4 cup sugar - 150g
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1\.25 cup plain flour - 160g
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

Beat butter and sugar until creamy ("fluffy" and pale), then add eggs one by one, and the vanilla.  Whisk the flour, salt and baking power together, then add.  This is a thick batter.

- 3/4 lb plums (4-5 large)

Put batter in the pan, arrange plum halves on top, then sprinkle the streusel over.
