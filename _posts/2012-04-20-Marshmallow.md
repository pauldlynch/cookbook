- 2 tsp icing sugar
- 2 tsp cornflour
- 25g/1 oz gelatine
- 125 ml/4fl oz water
- 2 egg whites
- 500g/18 oz granulated sugar
- 250ml/9 fl oz water

20x20cm/8in tin

Oil the tin and coat with sieved icing sugar and cornflour.  Bloom the gelatine in 125ml/4 fl oz water, then warm to dissolve.  

Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks.  

Heat the sugar with 250ml/9 fl oz and dissolve.  Boil to 122C/252F (hard ball stage).  Pour the gelatine solution into the syrup - it will bubble up.  

Pour the syrup mixture into the egg whites, with the beater running.  When it turns to a melted marshmallow consistency, pour into the tin and cool (not in a fridge) for a couple of hours.  

Dust a board with the remaining icing sugar and cornflour mix; turn out the marshmallow and dust all over.  Cut with an oiled knife, and redust as you go.
