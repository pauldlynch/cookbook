- 1 sachet instant yeast (7g)
- 500g plain flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 55g caster sugar

- 3 medium egg yolks
- 125 ml milk (4.5 fl oz) - mix together in a mug/bowl

- 140ml warm water

- 70g light muscovado sugar
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 4 tbsp melted butter

- 17g icing sugar
- 4 tbs hot water

Mix together the salt, yeast, flour and caster sugar in a large bowl.  Add 140ml warm water (hand-hot; this is 5 fl oz), then add the milk/yolk mix.  Work well together, then knead until silky smooth and not quite sticky.  I found that these quantities were a little too wet, resulting in a sticky dough.  Leave to rise until doubled, or until a gently prod with a finger doesn't spring promptly and fully back (under 5 seconds).  This should take around 90 minutes in a warm kitchen - but length of time isn't important.

Mix the muscovado sugar and cinnamon.  You may want to give this a quick whizz in a blender, or with a hand mixer, to break down the sugar if it is lumpy.

Gently push down the dough and remove it from the bowl to a floured work surface.  If it was sticky to start with, sprinkle a handful of flour over it, turn it over, and sprinkle some more.  Lightly knead (a couple of turns), rest the dough for a couple of minutes so that it will be easier to roll out, then roll to 12" x 18" approximately.  Paint the surface with the melted butter, then sprinkle with the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  If there is any left over butter, pour it over the cinnamon to wet it slightly.

Then roll the dough tightly, along the long side, making an 18" swiss roll.  Cut into 16 slices, and put them onto a well greased baking sheet.  There won't be much space between individual rolls, which is intentional.  Allow to prove for a short while under a plastic cover (in a carrier bag, or under a clingfilm wrap) - 15...20 minutes, or until there is a noticeable rise.

Bake for about 25 minutes in a 375F/190C oven.

Mix the icing sugar with about 4 tbsp of hot water (just boiled).  Pour this over the rolls as they come out of the oven, still hot, on their baking sheet.

Comments: this dough was very sticky and hard to handle, and also very rich.  I used large rather than medium eggs.  It would be worth trying with 2 large egg yolks instead, and slightly less milk - maybe 4 fl oz (a half cup measure).  However, the final quality was good.  I would also consider mixing the melted butter into the cinnamon sugar mix, as some dry cinnamon in the cooked rolls is a little harsh.  This might be hard to spread on the dough sheet, however, so I'd want to experiment with this a little.
