##Shortcrust

This is sufficient for a double crust 9" pie.

- 8 oz plain flour
- 4 oz fat (either all butter, or half/half butter and lard)
- pinch salt
- approx 3 tbs cold water

Make sure that the fat is straight from the fridge.  Sift the flour into a mixing bowl, and cut up the fat with a cold knife into the flour, so that it becomes coated with the flour as you cut it.  Rub well in, using only the tips of your fingers.  Bring together with the least amount of water and kneading possible, then wrap in foil/clingfilm and leave in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling out.
