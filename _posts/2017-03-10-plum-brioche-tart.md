## Ingredients

### Brioche recipe (makes brioche for two tarts)

- 260g strong white bread flour
- pinch salt
- 25g caster sugar
- 7g instant yeast
- 70ml warm milk
- 3 eggs
- 125g unsalted butter, room temperature
- zest of one orange

### Creme Patissiere (for one tart)

- 40g caster sugar
- 2 egg yolks
- 20g cornflour
- 250ml milk
- 1 vanilla pod
- 1 small cinnamon stick
- 20g unsalted butter

### To finish (for one tart)

- 6-8 ripe plums (approx 550g), cored and cut into 4 slices
- handful of roasted flaked almonds
- 100g apricot jam, to glaze

## Directions

To make the Brioche dough and Creme Patissiere the night before:

Place the flour, salt and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Combine
the three ingredients and then add in the yeast. Add in the milk and
eggs. Mix these on medium speed for 5-8 minutes until the dough is
glossy and elastic. With the mixer still on medium speed, add in the
orange zest and softened butter in small chunks until it is all
incorporated. Continue to mix the dough for another 5 minutes until it
is smooth and soft.

Tip the dough into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and chill in
the fridge overnight.

To make the creme patissiere: Place the milk and cinnamon stick into a
saucepan and onto medium heat. Split the vanilla pod in half
lengthways and scrape the seeds into the milk with the empty pod. In a
small bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg yolks and cornflour.

Once the milk has just come to the boil, remove the vanilla pod and
cinnamon stick. Pour half of it over the egg yolks and whisk in
immediately. Add this mix into the rest of the hot milk and place back
onto the heat. Whisking continuously, the mix will begin to thicken
and bubble. Once the mix starts to bubble, whisk for another 30
seconds and take the creme off the heat.

Whisk in the butter until it has melted. Spoon the creme into a bowl
and cover with cling film (make sure the cling film is actually
touching the surface of the creme to stop a skin forming.) Leave to
chill in the fridge until needed.

To assemble the tart the next day:

Line a baking tray with baking parchment.

Take your brioche dough out of the fridge and tip it onto a lightly
floured kitchen counter. Punch down the dough a few times to knock out
the air. Split the dough into two equal pieces (see notes.) Use one
piece for your tart and see notes to use the second.

Shape the dough into a ball and roll out into a 23cm circle. Move to
the baking tray. Spoon on your creme patissiere from the fridge (you
may not need all of it) and spread it in a thin layer on top of the
brioche, making sure to leave a border around the edge.

Cover with a clean plastic bag, making sure it doesn’t touch the creme
and prove for 2 hours.

Pre-heat your oven to 200C.

Once the brioche is proved, remove the plastic bag. Arrange your plum
slices on top of the brioche tart in a circle. Bake for 20-25 minutes
until golden brown.

To Finish the tart:

Warm the apricot jam with a little water in a saucepan until hot and
liquid. Using a pastry brush, coat the top of the tart so that it’s
shiny and glazed. Sprinkle on your roasted almonds and serve warm.

## Notes

This brioche recipe makes 2 tarts. The reason for this is that
it’s impossible to make a smaller amount of dough in a stand mixer as
the dough hook wouldn’t reach. The recipe I am giving makes enough
brioche dough for 2 tarts but the rest of the recipe is for one tart
as I think its unlikely you guys are going to make 2. However, if you
wish to make two, double the creme patissiere recipe and plums.

I would recommend making the full amount of dough, making two tarts
or making one tart and using the remaining dough to make a brioche
loaf or individual rolls. You can attempt to make half the brioche
recipe by hand, however its very messy and can take a long time to
work the  dough.
