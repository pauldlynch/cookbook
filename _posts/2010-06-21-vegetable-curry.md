## Ingredients
- tbs oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
- 1/2 tin tomatoes, chopped
- 2 green chilies
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- handful fresh coriander
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp tumeric
- 6 carrots, sliced
- 3 potatoes, 1-2 cm dice
- 2 cups peas
- 1/2 tbs butter

## Equipment
- Large saucepan
- spatula

## Method
Heat the oil in the pan on a medium heat, and soften the onion and garlic to a golden colour (5 minutes).  Watch that it doesnâ€™t burn.

Add the tomatoes, chili, ginger, coriander, salt, garam masala and tumeric with a splash of water (if needed).  Stir and watch carefully, until the oil separates.  5-10 minutes.

Add the vegetables and 1/4 cup water and stir well to coat with the sauce.  Cover and cook on a low heat for 20 minutes.

Check the consistency; you may need to turn up the heat to reduce, but the vegetables should be soft but firm still.  Stir in the butter and top with a tablespoon of chopped coriander.

Serve with dahl and naan or roti and pickles or chutney.
