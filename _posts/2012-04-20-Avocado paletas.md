makes 4

- 1 small ripe avocado
- 1 cup (8 fl oz) water
- 1/4 cup (50 g) sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

Put the sugar and water into a saucepan and simmer until fully dissolved. You need to keep it at a simmer for a couple of minutes, as this helps prevent the sugar separating out later.

Cool to room temperature, then blend with the avocado flesh, lime juice and salt.

Put into moulds and freeze for 1-2 hours, then insert the wooden sticks.  This is so that they stay vertical and don't sink to the bottom (or float to the top).

Finish freezing, total time is probably about 4-5 hours.  If you try to take them out too soon, the stick may come out on its own.  Run them under a tap for a few seconds to help them release from the moulds.
