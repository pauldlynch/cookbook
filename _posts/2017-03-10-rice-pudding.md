Adapted from Delia Smith's Cookery Course, the original version.

## Ingredients

- 110g pudding rice
- 850ml milk
- 50g butter
- 75g caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- grated rind of half a lemon
- nutmeg

## Directions

Preheat oven to 150C
Butter a 1 litre baking dish

First put the rice in a saucepan, add the milk and bring it slowly
almost to summering point, then let it cook very gently until the rice
is practically tender, which should take about ten to fifteen minutes
(or possibly longer).

Next add the sugar and butter and stir until they have dissolved and
melted. Now take the saucepan off the heat and let the mixture cool a
little, then stir in the eggs - well beaten - with the lemon peel.

Pour the mixture into the baking dish, sprinkle on some freshly grated
nutmeg and bake for 30 - 40 minutes - or longer if you prefer a
thicker consistency. Serve with pouring cream.
